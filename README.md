# Data205 Capstone
Local Enviornmental Data Science:

This project was conducted as part of my Data Science certification program at Montgomery College, and in partnership with Montgomery County Government. The plan is to take several data sets from Data Montgomery and to map out local activity that coorelate to pollution. Using maps of the local watershed bounderies we can hopefully isolate factors of pollution in the county.
